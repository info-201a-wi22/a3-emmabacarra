For this assignment, I will be comparing data drawn from `incarceration_trends` and  
`jail_jurisdiction`, observing any differences between demographics such as race and
gender. The information recorded in `incarceration_trends` is based on incarcerated
populations & the surrounding areas on a county-level basis. `jail_jurisdiction` is
based on incarcerated populations in local county jails.

Note:
Jail refers to individuals who are held in lawful custody (i.e. have been convicted
of a minor offense or are waiting to go on trial for their accusation) for a short
period of time. The word jail implies that it is a smaller, local facility. Prison
refers to individuals who have been convicted of more serious offenses and are
sentenced to longer terms. Prison can also be referred to as "state prison" or 
"federal prison", and refers to a larger facility of confinement than a county jail.
